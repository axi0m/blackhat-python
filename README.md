### blackhat-python

Simple repo of scripts and tools created from the Black Hat Python book by Justin Seitz. Improvements may exist as I make them or get better at understanding my tools/python but in such an event that real improvements are made, I'll migrate those to another repository. 

### Installing
1. Do not install. I doubt any of the examples will work for you.
2. No seriously, stahp right now!
3. OK, if you must...
```
pipenv install 
python <filename>.py
```
